"""Local import: process Snapchat bulk-export ZIPs (inline media) instead of downloading.

Newer Snapchat exports ("Export your Memories" selected) bundle the actual media
inside the export ZIPs (memories/<UTC-date>_<UUID>-main.<ext> plus optional
memories/<...>-overlay.png) and ship a memories_history.json whose
"Media Download Url" / "Download Link" fields are EMPTY. Nothing can be
downloaded; instead, this module maps each JSON entry to its inline file and
runs the same overlay-merge + metadata pipeline used for downloads.

Mapping key: the ZIP member's DOS timestamp is the entry's UTC capture time at
2-second resolution (odd seconds truncate down). (media type, UTC floored to an
even second) matches every file to its JSON entry; simultaneous bursts inside
the same 2-second window are assigned in chronological order.

JSON entries with no media file are classified into missing_media.csv:
most are duplicate ledger rows whose twin entry (same second/type) HAS the file.
